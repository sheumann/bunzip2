If you got this far and the "cmp"s didn't complain, it looks
like you're in business.

To install in /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/man, type
   dmake justinstall
To install somewhere else, eg, /xxx/yyy/{bin,man}, type
   dmake justinstall PREFIX=/xxx/yyy
If you are (justifiably) paranoid and want to see what
'dmake install' is going to do, type
   dmake -n justinstall                      or
   dmake -n justinstall PREFIX=/xxx/yyy      repsectively.
The -n instructs make to show the commands it would
execute, but not actually execute them.

You can do "bunzip2 --help" to see some helpful information.
"bunzip2 -L" displays the software license.
